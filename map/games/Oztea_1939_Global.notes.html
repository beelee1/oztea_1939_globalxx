<br>
<br><em>The world stands on the brink of catastrophe. The rising tide of fascism approaches the breakwater of history, as the dictatorial regimes of Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and The Italian Empire seek to expand their rule across the entire planet. A decade of instigation, skirmishes, and attempts to placate these tyrants have failed. And so the world plunges into a new World War. The German Reich, wants “Living Space” to expand it’s nation, which it plans to absorb from it’s west and it’s east. The Italians seek to restore the glory of the Roman Empire and dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. While the Japanese Empire desires to flush out the western colonial powers from Asia, and establish a Pan-Asian Co-Prosperity sphere, with themselves at it’s apex. Their goals are lofty, and if successful these powers would establish a new world order. However, standing against them, weary from the last war, disorganized by purges and economic depressions stand the Allied Powers. The strength of The United Kingdom, its Commonwealth and French Republic may be waning, but they will not see the world fall into a new dark age without a fight. The Soviet Union, stands as their unlikely ally, since it too finds itself in the cross-hairs of the fascist wolves. Will it be able to withstand the coming storm? Though the new world, and the United States stands reluctant to spill blood and treasure in this most trying of times. Political willpower is hard to come by, and though the economy has begun to recover and some strength has been regained, the world holds it’s breath in hope they will decide in time to rescue the world from a new dark age. The year is 1939, and the war to decide the fate of the world has begun.</em><br>

Check the box in "Map Options" before game start. You will need to declare war against the True Neutrals in order to attack them. You will need to <b>Player Enforce</b> correct "Neutral" behavior if needed. <br><br> 
Neutral Ships don’t affect naval at all unless you are attacking them. Neutral Navies are represented with a "Neutral_Navy" <img src="Neutral_Navy.png"/> unit placed in their Home country. You will need to <b>Edit</b> the appropriate number of Ships <b>Before</b> your Combat Move.<br><br>
When attacking a neutral, the units written here are immediately placed in the attacked territory as well as any territories alligned to them (triplea does this automatically). The opposing team will pick a player<b> Player Enforced</b> to represent those forces and collect income from any of their territories you failed to take. So, after combat, use edit to change any surviving units and the territory itself, to the Player of your choice.<br>

<b>Optional</b><br>
Escorts and Interceptors A2D2<br>
Escorts and Interceptors now attack and defend on 2. Activates via "Map Options".<br><br>
  <b>Optional</b><br>
Vichy Option<br>
Adds Vichy rules. They are as follows:<br>
If Germany conquers France on turn 2 and only turn 2, it will activate the "Vichy Option". After their Non Combat Move, each French territory will be rolled for to determine if they become Vichy controlled or not. A roll of 1,2 or 3 and the territory turns Vichy. A 4,5 or 6 and it remains Free French. The only exception is "Southern France" which automatically turns Vichy.<br><br>
Southern France will also have 2 Vichy Infantry placed there. All Vichy territories and units are represented by the "Neutral Axis". They behave the same as Non-Vichy Pro-Axis Neutrals.<br><br>
If any Allied units are present in a territory that becomes Vichy, on their turn they have the option to stay and fight or leave, if possible. The only exception are air units, which are destroyed.<br><br>
At the begininng of France's 2nd turn, each French Naval Unit will be rolled for to determine if they become Vichy. A roll of 1,2 or 3 and the Unit is imemdiately ordered to the Vichy Harbor in Sea Zone 93. A 4,5 or 6 and it remains Free French.<br><br>
Vichy ordered ships must take the most direct route possible to Sea Zone 93. They may not attack (Player Enforced) but can defend normally. Once a Vichy ordered ship arrives in 93 Sea Zone, it will "turn" Vichy at the end of the turn. Vichy Ships are controlled by the "True Neutrals". You will need to declare war against them in order to attack Vichy Ships. They may not move and defend only.<br><br>
If a ship hasn't arrived in 93 Sea Zone by the end of French turn 3, it will not automatically turn "Vichy" if it enters 93 Sea Zone on the following turns. You may either use "Edit" or decide that the Captain has disregarded his orders and has stayed Free French.<br><br>
If Southern France is taken over by any Axis player, then all Vichy territories immediately revert to Free French. This includes any Vichy Units that are present.<br><br>
Vichy Naval Units are rolled for to determine their fate. On a roll of 1,2,3 or 4, the Fleet is scuttled and removed from play. On a roll of 5 or 6, another roll is taken. On a roll of 1,2 or 3, the Fleet reverts to Free French. On a roll of 4,5, or 6, it turns into the Axis player.<br><br>
If Southern France is controlled by an Allied player (excluding Russia) a roll of 1 thru 5 will scuttle the Fleet. A roll of 6 and the Fleet will revert to Free French. Vichy land territories are unaffected.<br><br>
If Southern France is taken control of by the Free French, the Fleet and all Vichy territories immediately revert to Free French. If France is liberated, all Vichy territories and units revert to Free French.
<br><br>
<b>Optional</b><br>
Capital Cash Once<br>
The second time a Capital is capurted it's PUs are destroyed instead of captured. Activates via "Map Options".

<b>Note</b><br>
This game uses the latest Global 1940 2nd Edition (successor to Alpha +3) rules, as posted on Larry's website.<br>
To blitz move mech_infantry with armour, you must click on them both at the same time (use CTRL to create waypoints).<br>
Paratroopers tech enables a second combat movement phase which happens right after the first combat movement phase, and the second one only allowes movement of paratrooping infantry.<br>
<br>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
The game is not meant to take over your responsibility in knowing the rules. For example, the game engine is not always going to restrict or allow certain attacks. 
It is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them. Most of the game notes that follow can be thought of as differences compared to WWIIv3 or WWIIv4 rules but obviously are not a complete manual for the game. 
Beginners to these games are suggested to ask for help in the lobby or on the forums at http://www.tripleawarclub.org<br>
You must always validate your own movement, especially air movement at sea.  The engine is not perfect.<br>
<br>

<b>Edit Mode</b><br>
If you ever need to create new UK units, always create "British" units, do not create "UK_Pacific" units (except for Factories and facilities, all UK_Pacific units turn into British units when placed normally).<br>
The Warbonds technology will give the PUs to the British, please use edit mode if you want some of it to go to UK Pacific.<br>
You may also need to use edit mode to correct things listed below.<br>
<br>

<br>Below is a list of rules that the TripleA game engine either does not enforce, or enforces incorrectly, at this point.
<br>Each item starts with a code in parentheses that represents how you may fix or correct the rule.
<br>(PE) = Player Enforced = You must be aware of the rule and must follow it. The engine will not stop you from breaking the rule.
<br>(CL) = Comment Log = You must record what you are doing in the comment log, because TripleA does not keep that information around. (To access the comment log, go to the 'view' menu, and click 'show comment log', then type a comment there.)
<br>(SR) = Save/Reload = You may save the game now or at the start of the phase, then reload it, in order to solve this problem.
<br>(EM) = Edit Mode = You must use Edit Mode to correct or fix the error, because the engine either disallows the rule or otherwise does something wrong that you can correct.
<br>(NA) = None Available = There is no fix available for this yet.
<br>
<br><b>Rules specific to 1940 the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (EM) You may ask for permission during your turn to move through a canal owned by a power you are not yet at war with (use edit mode to move them).
<br>* (CL) TripleA does not keep track of which neutral territories have been previously attacked (use comment log to keep track of this instead).
<br>* (PE) You are not allowed to blitz or move any units through Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You may not land air units in Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You can not fly over unfriendly neutrals, unless they are being attacked or they have previously been attacked.
<br>* (PE) Friendly Neutrals can not be 'captured' with an AA Gun, only by land units with an attack power.
<br>* (PE) You may not build facilities on territories that were Dutch at the start of your turn.
<br>* (PE) You may not attack a territory containing units owned by a nation that you are not at war with (even if the territory is owned by someone you are at war with).
<br>* (PE) USA may not end movement in seazone adjacent to Japanese controlled territories when not at war with Japan (Sea Zones 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 33, 34, 36, and 37).
<br>* (EM) Japan can fly over UK and French territories before going to war with them.
<br>* (EM) USA does not have to declare war at the end of USA 3 if they do not want to.
<br>* (PE) You may not conduct an amphibious assault from an allied transport if the defender could scramble and you have no other combat units to protect that transport.
<br>* (EM) If Russia is at war with Italy, but not with Germany, a German warship in sz125 will cancel Russia's national objective (and same if at war with Germany but not Italy, and there is an Italian boat in sz125).
<br>* (EM) If UK Pacific captures Japan, the money should go to UK Pacific, even if UK Pacific's capital is occupied.
<br>* (EM) You must place all units you purchased if you are able to, or as many as you can. Any units not placed get refunded to you (TripleA instead carries them over to the next turn).
<br>* (PE) The victory conditions must be held for a full continuous round after they are achieved (so for example if Italy takes Egypt as the 8th European VC, then the Axis must hold 8 VCs continuously until Italy's next turn).
<br>* (EM) Rocket damage to an airfield should occur after scrambling, which means if an airbase is disabled by the rocket attack, it could still scramble this turn.
<br>* (PE) Paratroopers (airborne) may not attack multiple territories from a single airbase.
<br>
<br><b>General rules for all A&A games that the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (PE) Battles should be resolved in this order: all SBR, then all Amphibious Assaults, then all others.
<br>* (SR or EM) Repairing and Purchase are should actually be done at the same time.
<br>* (CL) TripleA does keep track of which units are on which transports, but there is no easy way to see this information when it is not your turn.
<br>* (CL) TripleA should, but does not keep track of which air units are on which carriers.
<br>* (PE) All air moved must have a way of potentially being picked up or landing, and all air that survives combat MUST be picked up if possible.
<br>* (PE) TripleA should not allow non-combat moves to be done during combat move phase.
<br>* (PE) Only non-air units that did not move during combat move and did not participate in combat, may move during non-combat-move.
<br>* (PE) Transports can only be loaded in 1 phase (not both), and unloaded in 1 phase (not both).
<br>* (PE) Transports if unloading for amphibious assault, must unload all their units, and may not hold back some units while offloading other units.
<br>* (NA) Each phase of combat should have all units in that phase fire before any casualty selection occurs, whereas right now in TripleA if air and subs are involved then units might be broken up into smaller groups and casualty selection done for each group.
<br>* (EM) If you select for a bombardment from a sea zone, you should be able to select which units you want to have bombard, but currently all possible units are used.

<b>Political Situation</b><br>
At the start of the game Germany and Italy are at war with the UK and ANZAC and France only, while Japan is at war with China only. Any countries not at war with each other ignore each other's naval units and obviously cannot go into each others ground territories. There are a number of specific politically related rules/conditions for each country:<br><br>

<b>Germany/Italy/Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>Germany/Italy/Japan can declare war on USA or Russia or China at any time.</li>
<li>If Germany/Italy/Japan is at war with one of USA or Russia or China it doesn't affect relations with the other.</li>
<li>While not yet at war with the USA, Japan may not move into sea zones within 2 spaces of Western USA or Alaska.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>Russia cannot go to war against the Germans and Italians until the <b>beginning of purchase units phase</b> of Russia 4, unless of course they attack it first, or the Axis capture London.</li>
<li>Russia and Japan may declare war on each other at any time.  When not at war, Russia may not enter China.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>If USA is not at war with Germany or Italy, USA may only move its units to sea zones touching USA territories and also Sea Zone 102.</li>
<li>If USA is not at war with Japan, USA may not move its units into sea zones touching Japanese controlled territories.</li>
<li>USA cannot go to war against the Axis until the <b>beginning of PU collect phase</b> of USA 3, unless of course an Axis power attacks it first.</li>
<li>Once at war, the Minor Factories in continental USA upgrade to Major Factories automatically for free, and may be used immediately.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Neutrals</b><br>
There are three types of neutrals: 
<ul>
<li>pro-Axis: When an Axis unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>pro-Allies: When an Allied unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>Regular: If a power attacks a regular neutral, all the other regular neutrals on the board become friendly to the other team.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Capture of friendly neutrals must be done during Non Combat Movement.<br><br>

When a country moves into a regular or non-friendly neutral during the combat move, it must conduct combat with the number of infantry specified on the map for that neutral. If it loses or retreats, however many infantry that remain are how many that stay in the zone. This means that if Finland was +4 for Axis, and Russia kills 2 infantry and retreats, then Axis only get 2 infantry when they move into Finland.

</ul>
<br><hr><br>


<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Kamikaze Attacks</b><br>
Japan starts the game with 6 attack tokens, and may begin doing Kamikaze Attacks at the start of the game.<br>
These attacks can only be done in sea zones that contain the Kamikaze symbol [the sea zones surrounding: Japan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, and the Marianas].<br>
At the end of Japan's enemy's combat-move phase, Japan may target any surface warship in a Kamikaze zone for one or more Kamikaze attacks, ONLY if the enemy is attacking Japanese units there or is conducting an Amphibious Assault from that sea zone.<br>
For each attack, a die is rolled, and a 2 or less is considered a hit. Casualties are removed immediately, and do not participate in any battles. Kamikaze attacks prevent bombardment as well.<br>
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Submarines Prevent Unescorted Transports From Making Amphibious Assaults</b><br>
In any Sea Zone containing an enemy submarine, but not containing an owned warship, the submarine will prevent the offloading of troops for an amphibious assault. 
<br><br><hr><br>


<b>Scrambling</b><br>
Fighters and/or Tactical bombers can be scrambled from any territory bordering a sea zone, with an operating airfield (less than 3 damage) to help defend the surrounding sea zone using their standard defense values. They cannot retreat from scrambling (defenders can never retreat) and if the territory they were scrambled from is captured, they're given one extra movement point to land on a friendly territory or open carrier. Scrambled air cannot participate in any other battles that round.
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Strategic Bombing Runs (SBR)</b><br>
Bombing can now happen against both types of ICs, harbours, and airfields (attackers choice)[tactical bombers can not target factories though]. Fighters can participate in the bombing run as escorts. Fighters in the territory being bombed can be launched as interceptors (no airfield necessary).<br><br>
<b>If interceptors are launched:</b> a one-round air battle takes place right away all air involved roll at 1 (jets rolls at 2). Either attacking bombers or fighters can be taken as casualties.<br><br>
After the air battle, or if there were no interceptors, the escorts are retreated and any bombers/tacs remaining can now be divied up to attack specific targets. Each target rolls its built-in AA gun against the bombers/tacs targetting it. If there is an AA gun in the territory being bombed it does <b>not</b> roll because its there to defend combat units and not complexes/bases.
<br><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Blockade Zones</b><br>
If any enemy ships are in a power's blockade zones at the end of that power's turn, and the power controls the adjacent ground territory, then the power may lose some of the PUs it would have otherwise collected.<br>
Surface warships roll 1 dice, Submarines and Air units roll 2 dice, and carriers and transports roll zero dice.  For any roll of 3 or less, that amount of PUs will not be collected by the surrounding land territories.
The power in question cannot lose more PUs from a blockade zones then the worth of the adjacent ground territory to those zones.

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Placement Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 3 or more, and must be originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 2 or more.</li>
<li>Industrial Complexes can't be built on islands.</li>
<li>Over-purchase is returned and money is reimbursed.</li>
<li>Aircraft can be placed on the ground or on a [new] carrier in the adjacent sea zone that has a spot(s) open.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>

<b>Units</b><br>
These changes to units are things other than price/movement which you can see in the buy menu.
<ul>
<li>Bombers now do 2 additional damage in strategic bombing raids, in addition to their dice roll.</li>
<li>Carriers are two hit.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes have 3 production capacity. A Minor IC can be upgraded to a Major IC for 20 PUs, but only on originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes have 10 production capacity. When a Major IC is captured it automatically becomes a minor IC.</li>
<li>AA Guns may be taken casualty in combat, and may only fire at up to 3 aircraft each.</li>
</ul>

<b>New Units</b><br>
<b>Tactical Bombers:</b> can land on carriers, can bomb, and if paired with <b>a tank or fighter</b> the Tac attacks at 4. Tactical Bombers can also strategic bomb Airfields and Harbours (but not factories).<br>
<b>Mechanized Infantry:</b> can blitz when paired with a tank, and are supportable by artillery.<br>
<b>Carriers:</b> now have 2 hitpoints, and when damaged they do not allow fighters to land, or to leave if cargo.<br>
<br>
<b>New Buildings</b><br>
<b>Harbour:</b> Any ships that start their turn in a sea zone adjacent to a harbour get +1 movement points. Any damaged ships are repaired by a harbour at the start of the player's purchase and repair turn phase. Lastly, harbours can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the above bonuses.<br>
<b>Airfield:</b> Any air that start their turn on the ground territory with an airfield get +1 movement points. Airfields allow up to 3 planes on that island to scramble (see Scramble section above). Airfields can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the movement bonus.
